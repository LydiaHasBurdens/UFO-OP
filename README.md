# UFO-OP
A project using processing to read in a dataset and display it using various visual means.

Dataset:  ufocase.txt (in the data folder)

Source:  www.ufocasebook.com

Description:  UFO/Alien Cases, including categorical outcomes:
Presence/Absence of physical effects, multimedia (picture/video),
ET contact, and abduction.

#My Assignment

##Data Visualization
1. I plan to use a trend graph to show the number of UFO reports per year from 1865 to 2004.
2. The dataset includes the location of the sighting(country/region) I want to use an image of the earth and overlay dots or just color that region in a particular way to show which areas show most UFO activity.
3. The third and final visualization of the data will reflect a number of different data elements using an image of a person to represent a report(1 line of data). E.g. the people will be in columns based on country, the color of the person represents ET contact, if the person has a camera in hand they have multimedia evidence etc...

I want to wrap these visualizations into a 3D menu, allowing the user to select which data they want to see in an easy to understand manner.

##3D menu
Could take one of two forms:

1. The three options are in front of the user one behind the other. The user uses the UP and DOWN arrows to navigate, skipping forward to preset postions in front of a dataset thumbnail type image, if they want to see that data they press enter.
2. The three options are infront of the user angled in an arc with the user in the centre, the user uses the RIGHT and LEFT arrows to turn on the spot using enter to view the data in front of them.

In both scenarios the space bar will return user to menu.


#FINAL SUB

I decided on the UP/DOWN controls for the menu. ENTER selects the graph and 0 brings you back to the menu.

The only graph that changed from the initial plan is the person graph. There proved to be too many countries to split the people into, instead i left them in neat rows, same colour, but with different icons attached to them depending on what type of report they filed.
